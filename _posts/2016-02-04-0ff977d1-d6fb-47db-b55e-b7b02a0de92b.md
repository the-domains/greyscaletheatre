Gods Are Fallen And All Safety Gone

GODS ARE FALLEN AND ALL SAFETY GONE is an investigation into what 
happens when we discover that our parents are flawed human beings, and 
that at some point, sooner than we think, they are suddenly going to 
disappear from our lives. 

Intimate and funny, this play presents a lifetime of conversations, condensed into one hour.
